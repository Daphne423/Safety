    <!--    \nThe story of the prodigal son is one of the most insightful, memorable stories that Jesus told while He was on Earth.-->
    <!--    \n-->
    <!--    <b>1</b>-->
    <!--    \nThrough it, Christ brought to light the ravages of sin, the value of true repentance, and the love of the heavenly Father.-->
    <!--    \n-->
    <!--    \nBy putting that story into rhyming verse on a childâ€™s level, A Son Who Ran Away offers an easy-to-understand resource for teaching children the meaning and importance of the prodigal son.-->
    <!--    \n-->
    <!--    <b>2</b>-->
    <!--    \nIn the story, a father has two sons. The younger son asks for his portion of inheritance from his father, who grants his son\'s request.-->
    <!--    \n-->
    <!--    \nThis son however is prodigal that is wasteful and extravagant thus squandering his fortune and eventually becoming destitute.-->
    <!--    \nAs consequence, he now must return home empty-handed and intend to beg his father to accept him back as a servant. To the son's surprise, he is not scorned by his father but is welcomed back with celebration and a welcoming party.-->
    <!--    \nEnvious, the older son refuses to participate in the festivities.\n-->
